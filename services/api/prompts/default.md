Goal
Upgrade this interior photo into a luxury-grade, editorial real estate image.
Apply the lighting, color, and exposure style described below. Make the style adjustments clearly visible — the result should look professionally color-graded and lit, not identical to the original.
Remove clutter and clean surfaces as described below.
Preserve architecture, layout, furnishings, and materials exactly.

Preservation Rules
Preserve the exact room layout, architecture, and spatial geometry.
Preserve all fixed elements exactly as-is: walls, ceilings, openings, trim, baseboards, crown molding, soffits, columns, fireplaces, built-ins, railings, permanent lighting, vents, outlets, switches, alarms, access panels, and utility details.
Preserve built-ins and casework geometry exactly: seams, panel spacing, edges, alignment.
Preserve cabinet and drawer faces exactly as photographed, including any hardware that is visible. If hardware is absent, leave it absent.
Preserve all major furnishings, fixtures, and appliances exactly in presence, position, scale, and color.
Preserve original aspect ratio, proportions, and perceived room scale.
Preserve the original frame boundaries; work within them only.
Preserve original materials, finishes, and true material behavior: wood grain, fabric weave, stone detail, metal reflections, glass transparency.

Furniture and Object Handling
Keep all existing large furniture in place; maintain exact position, scale, and color.
Micro-adjustments for alignment only, without relocation.
Straighten existing frames, lampshades, mirrors, and decor in-place only.
Curtains and linens: straighten only, preserve style.
Beds: smooth and straighten existing bedding; align edges; keep natural texture; preserve pillow count, style, and fabric.
Towels: neatly fold or hang existing towels; keep same towels and colors.
If multiple matching dining chairs are present, preserve them as a consistent set.

Declutter
Remove small portable clutter and visual noise cleanly; fill removed areas with the existing surface or background.
Remove personal identifiers: family photos, mail, certificates, names, addresses, badges.
Remove floor-level loose items: bags, shoes, laundry, boxes, random accessories.
Remove small distracting surface items: papers, packaging, loose cables, chargers, remotes, toiletries, cleaning bottles, scattered electronics.
Preserve purposeful room-function items and intentional appliances already present: kitchen appliances on counters, desk chairs at desks, dining chairs at tables.
If uncertain whether an item belongs, keep it.

Mirrors and Reflections
Reflections must be geometrically correct and consistent with the scene.
Remove people, cameras, tripods, and glare artifacts from reflections.
Fill reflection gaps with logically continued existing architecture only.

Windows and Exterior Views
Preserve window geometry and framing exactly.
If the exterior view has recoverable detail, gently recover it (up to 1-2 stops) while preserving what is truly visible.
If exterior detail is blown out, keep it naturally bright rather than fabricating scenery.
Maintain exterior exposure 0.5-1 stop darker than interior when detail exists; otherwise allow natural highlight roll-off.

Photographic Realism
Maintain real photographic texture: natural grain, material imperfections, fabric wear, surface variation.
Preserve true depth of field and natural shadow roll-off.
Light must read as originating from existing windows and practical lights already present.
Enhance only existing light; fill shadow areas with subtle, realistic lift where natural falloff already exists.
Maintain gentle, natural contrast with rich midtones and readable shadow detail.
Protect highlights in windows, fixtures, and glossy surfaces from clipping.

Hard Constraints
Do not add, invent, or imply any object, furniture, fixture, decor, plant, rug, or architectural feature not present in the source.
Do not replace removed items with new ones. Do not invent decor to fill space.
Do not add people, pets, silhouettes, text, logos, or watermarks.
Do not apply CGI, illustration, or painterly rendering. No waxy surfaces, fake marble, or invented textures.
Do not produce halos, crunchy HDR, exaggerated clarity, glow, bloom, or soft-focus effects.
