White Balance and Color
 • Target slightly warm daylight whites around 5600K to 6200K equivalent warmth feel, while keeping whites clean, not yellow.
 • Remove green cast first; then reduce muddy orange/yellow buildup without stripping warmth from wood and textiles.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white or creamy yellow.
 • Maintain cozy warmth in warm materials (wood, brass, beige fabrics) without letting warmth tint ceilings or neutral walls.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Lift walls and ceilings subtly (+0.1 to +0.2 EV) to feel welcoming, not clinical.
 • Preserve rich midtones; avoid flat HDR.
 • Allow slightly deeper blacks than “Clean Daylight” for an editorial feel, but keep shadow detail readable.
 • Protect highlights in fixtures, lamps, and window edges; no clipping.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must still read as originating from existing windows and/or practical lights already present.
 • Enhance ambient warmth via realistic bounce and practical glow only where it already exists; no invented light sources.
 • Preserve natural shadow roll-off and depth; do not flatten the room.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Keep floors and warm-toned materials naturally warm and inviting.
 • Prevent orange/yellow cast bleed onto walls and ceilings; neutrals stay neutral.
 • Preserve material richness and texture; no plastic smoothing.
Finishing
 • Minimal dehaze only if needed; keep a soft, editorial atmosphere.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.75 stop maximum, only if it feels natural.
 • Gentle micro-contrast with rich midtone depth; no sharpening halos, crunchy texture, glow, bloom, soft-focus tricks, or dreamy grading.
