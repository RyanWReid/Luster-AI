White Balance and Color
 • Target neutral daylight whites around 5200K to 5600K.
 • Remove green cast first; then neutralize yellow, orange, blue, and magenta casts without bleaching materials.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white.
 • Maintain natural warmth in wood and other warm-toned materials, if present, without letting warmth contaminate walls or ceilings.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Lift walls and ceilings slightly (+0.1 to +0.25 EV) to feel bright and clean without looking processed.
 • Maintain gentle, natural contrast; avoid HDR crunch, halos, or exaggerated clarity.
 • Protect highlights in windows, chandelier bulbs, and glossy surfaces; no clipping.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must read as coming from the existing windows and openings.
 • Add only subtle, realistic lift to shadow areas that already have light falloff; no invented lighting.
 • Preserve soft shadow roll-off and real depth; do not flatten the room.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Keep floors and wood tones warm and believable.
 • Prevent color cast bleed onto walls and ceilings; walls stay clean and neutral.
 • Avoid over-brightening floors into a washed look.
Finishing
 • Minimal dehaze only if needed for window haze or low-contrast rooms.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.75 stop maximum, only if it improves focus and feels natural.
 • Gentle micro-contrast only; no sharpening halos, crunchy texture, glow, bloom, or dreamy grading.
