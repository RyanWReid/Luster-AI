White Balance and Color
 • Target neutral whites around 5200K to 5600K.
 • Neutralize green cast first; then gently reduce yellow/orange/blue/magenta without bleaching materials.
 • Keep warmth in wood and warm fabrics natural, but keep that warmth off walls and ceilings.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white or tint them warm.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Protect highlights aggressively; preserve a gentle highlight roll-off with no clipping.
 • Lift shadows slightly (+0.1 to +0.25 EV) for a calm, expensive feel.
 • Slightly reduced overall contrast; rich midtones remain intact.
 • Avoid HDR look entirely; no halos, no crunch, no exaggerated clarity.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must read as coming from existing windows and openings.
 • Add only soft, realistic lift where natural falloff exists; no invented lighting or dramatic spotlighting.
 • Preserve depth, but keep transitions smooth and understated.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Maintain believable warmth in floors and warm materials, if present.
 • Prevent warmth bleed onto walls and ceilings; neutrals stay neutral.
 • Preserve real texture and reflectivity; do not smooth into waxy or plastic surfaces.
Finishing
 • No dehaze unless the image is genuinely hazy; if used, keep it minimal and invisible.
 • Minimal micro-contrast; lower “digital sharpness” while keeping true detail.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.5 stop maximum, only if it feels natural.
 • No sharpening halos, crunchy texture, glow, bloom, soft-focus tricks, or dreamy grading.
