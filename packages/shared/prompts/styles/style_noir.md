White Balance and Color
 • Target neutral-to-warm whites around 5200K to 6000K feel; warm enough to feel luxe, not amber.
 • Remove green cast first; then tame excessive yellow/orange without stripping natural warmth from wood and stone.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white or tint them orange.
 • Keep highlights clean and controlled; no warm color wash across ceilings.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Do not “brighten everything.” Maintain intentional depth with deeper shadows.
 • Controlled highlights with smooth roll-off; protect windows, fixtures, and glossy surfaces; no clipping.
 • Minimal fill; lift only the darkest areas slightly (+0.05 to +0.15 EV) so detail remains readable.
 • Avoid HDR behavior entirely; no halos, no crunchy clarity.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must read as coming from existing windows and/or practical lights already present.
 • Emphasize directional light and natural falloff; preserve dramatic shadow shape and depth.
 • If practical lights are visible (pendants, sconces, fireplace glow), enhance subtly but keep it realistic; no invented light sources.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Preserve richness in wood, stone, and warm textures; keep them dimensional, not flat.
 • Prevent warmth bleed onto walls and ceilings; neutrals stay neutral.
 • Preserve real texture and reflectivity; no waxy smoothing or fake sheen.
Finishing
 • No dehaze unless truly needed; keep atmosphere intact.
 • Moderate micro-contrast focused on midtones for architectural definition; avoid crunchy edges and sharpening halos.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.75 stop maximum to enhance mood naturally.
 • No glow, bloom, soft-focus tricks, or dreamy grading.
