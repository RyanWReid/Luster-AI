White Balance and Color
 • Target slightly cool neutral daylight whites around 4800K to 5200K.
 • Keep whites crisp and clean; neutralize yellow and orange warmth without sterilizing natural materials.
 • Remove green cast first; then reduce residual blue without letting walls go icy or cyan.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white or shift neutrals into blue-gray.
 • Hard rule: neutrals must be neutral; no pink, magenta, blush, or mauve cast in walls, rugs, ceilings, white furniture, or trim.
 • Correct tint (green-magenta) before temperature; if any cast exists, bias correction slightly toward green, then set final cool-neutral.
 • Preserve true reds only where they exist (pillow, books, art); do not let red bleed into surrounding neutrals.
 • Grays must stay true gray; no purple shift in shadows or midtones.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Lift walls and ceilings subtly (+0.1 to +0.25 EV) for a bright, modern feel.
 • Maintain clean separation between highlights, midtones, and shadows; no HDR halos or crunch.
 • Protect highlights in windows, glossy counters, chrome, and fixtures; no clipping.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must read as coming from existing windows and openings.
 • Add only subtle, realistic lift in shadow zones that already have falloff; no invented lighting.
 • Preserve natural shadow roll-off and depth; avoid flattening.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Keep warm materials (wood, brass, warm fabrics) believable and slightly restrained so they don’t contaminate the overall cool-clean look.
 • Prevent color cast bleed onto walls and ceilings; neutrals stay clean.
 • Preserve real texture and reflectivity; no plastic smoothing.
Finishing
 • Minimal dehaze only if needed for clarity; keep it “gallery clean,” not gritty.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.5 stop maximum, only if it improves composition.
 • Slightly increased micro-contrast versus Natural Daylight Clean, but no sharpening halos or crunchy texture.
 • No glow, bloom, soft-focus tricks, or dreamy grading.
