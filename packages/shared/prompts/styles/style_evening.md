White Balance and Color
 • Target a tungsten-neutralized balance around 3600K to 4500K with a controlled hint of warmth.
 • Remove orange/yellow tungsten soup while keeping the room inviting; whites stay clean, not amber.
 • Neutralize green cast from mixed LEDs and practicals; avoid magenta overcorrection.
 • Preserve original wall hue; do not push walls to pure white or warm beige.
 • Keep warm materials (wood, brass, warm fabrics) naturally warm without letting warmth contaminate ceilings or neutral walls.
Exposure and Dynamic Range
 • Lift walls and ceilings subtly (+0.1 to +0.25 EV) to keep the room readable without turning night into day.
 • Protect highlights aggressively around fixtures, bulbs, and reflective surfaces; no clipping, no blown halos.
 • Maintain controlled contrast; preserve midtone richness; avoid HDR flattening and crunchy clarity.
Light Direction and Realism
 • Light must read as coming from existing practical lights and any visible window light; no invented light sources.
 • Preserve realistic falloff from lamps and ceiling fixtures; keep shadows soft but present.
 • If mixed lighting exists (warm lamps plus cool window), balance gently without killing the natural evening mood.
Floors and Warm Materials
 • Maintain believable warmth in floors and warm materials, if present, without orange spill onto walls.
 • Prevent color cast bleed across neutrals; ceilings remain clean and neutral.
 • Preserve true texture and reflectivity; no waxy smoothing.
Finishing
 • Minimal dehaze only if needed; keep the evening atmosphere intact.
 • Gentle micro-contrast only; no sharpening halos, crunchy texture, glow, or bloom around lights.
 • Subtle lens-style vignette under 0.75 stop maximum, only if it feels natural.
 • No soft-focus tricks or dreamy grading.
