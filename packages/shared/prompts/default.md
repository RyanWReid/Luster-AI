Objective
• Upgrade the supplied interior photo to a luxury-grade, photoreal real estate image with editorial architectural quality.
 • Improve lighting, clarity, and cleanliness only.
 • Preserve the exact architecture, layout, and true materials. No fantasy upgrades.
Non-Negotiables
• No layout changes; no resizing, moving, adding, removing, widening, shrinking, or “improving” architectural elements.
 • No outpainting; do not extend beyond the original frame boundaries.
 • Do not change perceived room size; no stretching, widening, perspective tricks, or “bigger room” manipulation.
 • Preserve all fixed details exactly as-is: walls, ceilings, openings, trim, baseboards, crown molding, soffits, columns, fireplaces, built-ins, railings, permanent lighting, vents, outlets, switches, alarms, access panels, and utility details.
 • Preserve built-ins and casework geometry exactly: seams, panel spacing, edges, alignment; no symmetry correction or redesign.
 • Preserve hardware only if visible; never invent missing hardware.
 • Cabinet and drawer faces: preserve exactly as photographed; do not add, remove, change, or infer knobs, pulls, handles, latches, hinges, or any hardware. If none are present, leave them absent.
 • No “completion” behavior: do not “finish” missing details; do not add standard fixtures or hardware that “should” exist.
 • Preserve all major furnishings, fixtures, and appliances exactly in presence, position, scale, and color. Do not swap, upgrade, relocate, or recolor.
 • No people, pets, silhouettes, or reflections of either.
 • No logos, text overlays, signage edits, or watermarks.
Conditional Instruction Rule
• Any instruction about a material or object applies only if that material or object is present in the source photo. Never add, invent, or imply missing materials or features to satisfy a rule.
Camera, Perspective, and Framing
• Simulate DSLR wide-angle logic; 24–28mm equivalent; camera height about 42 inches.
 • Correct verticals and lens distortion; walls and openings remain straight; no fisheye.
 • Keep a grounded, natural viewpoint; no surreal or drone-like perspective.
 • Preserve original aspect ratio and proportions; no stretching or squeezing.
 • Preserve the visible framing. Vertical correction is allowed. If edges are affected, micro-crop up to 5 percent per edge is allowed only to maintain clean verticals and composition. No recomposition beyond this.
Declutter Rules
• Remove small portable clutter and visual noise cleanly; do not blur clutter.
 • Remove personal identifiers: family photos, mail, certificates, names, addresses, badges, and similar identifiers.
 • Remove floor-level loose items and casual storage: bags, shoes, laundry, boxes, random accessories, loose stacks, under-furniture items (unless clearly built-in storage).
 • Remove small distracting surface items: papers, packaging, loose cables, chargers, remotes, toiletries, cleaning bottles, scattered small electronics, and miscellaneous countertop clutter.
 • Preserve purposeful, room-function items and intentional appliances already present. Examples: a microwave on a kitchen counter; a toaster oven; a coffee maker; a desk chair at a desk; dining chairs at the dining table.
 • Portable equipment may be removed only if it clearly reads as temporary clutter and not part of the room’s intended function.
 • If uncertain: preserve structure, remove small clutter only, and add nothing.
Belongingness and Cohesion Filter
• The scene must read like a top-tier editorial real estate photo: intentional, cohesive, and plausible.
 • Remove any portable item, decor, or loose object that feels oddball, temporary, overly personal, clutter-like, or visually inconsistent with the room’s purpose.
 • Keep only items that clearly belong and look intentional for the room’s function.
 • Do not remove or alter built-in elements, installed fixtures, or architecture.
 • Do not remove major furnishings that define the room (bed, sofa, dining table, credenza, desk); only remove small to medium portable items and extra seating that reads as temporary.
 • Never replace removed items with new ones. Never invent decor to “fill space.”
 • If uncertain whether an item is intentional or part of the room’s functional setup, keep it.
Furniture and Realism
• Keep all existing large furniture in place; no swaps, upgrades, scale changes, or removals.
 • Micro-adjustments are allowed only for alignment without relocation.
 • You may slightly rotate existing chairs or stools for cleaner alignment while keeping their location.
 • Straighten existing frames, lampshades, mirrors, and decor in-place only.
 • Curtains and linens may be straightened only; no style changes.
 • Beds: smooth and straighten existing bedding; align edges; keep natural texture; do not add pillows, throws, or change bed type.
 • Pillows: fluff and center existing pillows; preserve count, style, fabric; do not add more.
 • Towels: neatly fold or hang existing towels; keep the same towels and colors; do not add new ones.
Dining Chair Set Integrity
• If multiple matching dining chairs are present, preserve them as a consistent set.
 • Do not introduce mismatched chair style, color, or material.
 • If a chair must be reconstructed due to occlusion, it must match the existing dining chair set exactly.
 • If a chair is clearly out of place for the room’s function (example: an office chair used as a dining chair), it may be removed as declutter. Do not replace it. If uncertain, keep it.
Minimal Micro-Staging
• Added items are optional, not required.
 • If added, allow 0–1 subtle, low-contrast item total, placed on an existing surface only.
 • Do not add furniture, lighting, rugs, wall art, plants, curtains, or any style-shifting decor.
 • If uncertain, add nothing.
 • Allowed examples (only if natural and subtle): one neutral book, one small ceramic bowl, one simple tray.
Mirrors and Reflections
• Reflections must be geometrically correct and consistent with the scene.
 • Remove people, cameras, tripods, and glare artifacts.
 • Replace reflections only with logically continued existing architecture; never invent new spaces or objects.
Windows and Exterior Views
• Preserve window geometry and cropping exactly.
Windows and Exterior Views
 • Preserve window geometry and cropping exactly.
Window Pull, Optional and Non-Inventive
 • If the exterior view contains recoverable detail, gently recover it (up to 1–2 stops) while preserving what is truly visible.
 • Do not invent or “enhance” beyond recovery. No new scenery, skies, buildings, or landscaping.
 • If exterior detail is blown out or not present, keep it naturally bright and uncluttered rather than fabricating detail.
 • Maintain exterior exposure 0.5–1 stop darker than interior when detail exists; otherwise allow natural highlight roll-off.
 • Enhance only what is truly visible outside, if any; do not invent scenery, skies, buildings, or landscaping.
 • Exterior exposure is 0.5–1 stop darker than interior when detail exists; otherwise allow natural highlight roll-off.
 • Enhance only what is truly visible outside, if any; do not invent scenery, skies, buildings, or landscaping.
Materials and Texture Fidelity
• Preserve original materials and finishes; no re-texturing or “material upgrades.”
 • Improve clarity without plastic smoothing, heavy noise reduction, or fake overlays.
 • Maintain true material behavior, if present: wood grain, fabric weave, stone detail, metal reflections, glass transparency.
 • Rugs, if present, lie flat; preserve design, colors, and placement.
Hard “Do Not”
• No CGI look; no illustration or painterly artifacts.
 • No waxy surfaces, plastic smoothing, fake marble veining, or invented textures.
 • No halos, crunchy HDR, heavy clarity, or artificial glow.
 • No invented fixtures, furniture, decor, window views, or architectural features.
